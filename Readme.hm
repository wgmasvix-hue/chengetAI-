# ChengetAi

ChengetAi is a digital agriculture intelligence platform designed to help farmers, institutions, and ministries make faster, data-driven decisions.

## Vision

To become the trusted decision layer for smallholder and commercial agriculture in Zimbabwe and beyond, by turning scattered data into clear, actionable insights.

## What ChengetAi does

- **Farmer-facing tools:**  
  Simple interfaces (mobile/web) that help farmers record activities, monitor fields, and receive timely alerts.

- **Institution dashboards:**  
  Aggregated views for ministries, NGOs, and financiers to track adoption, performance, and risk.

- **Data and insight engine:**  
  Ingestion of field data, weather, and market signals to power basic scoring, alerts, and reporting.

## Current status

ChengetAi is currently in the **prototype/experimentation** phase. This repository hosts:

- A **public landing page** (this GitHub Pages site)  
- High-level **documentation and concept notes**  
- Early **technical experiments** as the platform evolves

## Roadmap (high level)

- **Phase 1:** Concept landing page, stakeholder demos, data model sketch  
- **Phase 2:** Farmer and institution dashboards (MVP)  
- **Phase 3:** Scoring, alerts, and integrations with partner systems
